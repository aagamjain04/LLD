# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Overview

The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Key Concepts

### Intent
- Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver
- Give more than one object a chance to handle the request
- Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it

### Problem It Solves
- Multiple objects can handle a request, but the handler isn't known beforehand
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly
- The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically

## Structure

### Core Components

1. **Handler (Abstract)**: Defines interface for handling requests and implements successor link
2. **ConcreteHandler**: Handles requests it's responsible for; forwards others to successor
3. **Client**: Initiates request to ConcreteHandler object on the chain

The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a clean way to handle requests through a chain of processors. 
It promotes loose coupling and flexibility while allowing dynamic configuration of request handling. 
The pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects can process a request and the appropriate handler is determined at runtime.
