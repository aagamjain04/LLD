# Strategy Design Pattern in Java

## Overview

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives runtime instructions specifying which algorithm to use.

## Key Components

1. **Strategy Interface**: Defines the common interface for all supported algorithms
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the Strategy interface with specific algorithms
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates algorithm execution to it

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Algorithms can be switched at runtime
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code
- **Eliminates Conditional Statements**: Reduces complex conditional logic for algorithm selection
- **Separation of Concerns**: Strategy implementations are isolated from their usage context



## Real-World Applications

- **Sort Algorithms**: Different sorting algorithms for different data types/sizes
- **Compression Strategies**: Different compression algorithms based on file type
- **Payment Methods**: Different payment processing for various payment types
- **Navigation Strategies**: Different pathfinding algorithms in GPS systems
- **Authentication Methods**: Different authentication mechanisms (password, biometric, token)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overhead for Simple Cases**: May be overengineered for applications with few algorithms
2. **Client Must Be Aware of Strategies**: The client needs to understand which strategy to use
3. **Increased Number of Objects**: Creates more objects compared to simple conditional statements
4. **Communication Overhead**: Strategy and Context may need to share information

## When to Use

- When you need different variants of an algorithm
- When you want to isolate the algorithm implementation details from the code that uses it
- When you have many related classes that differ only in their behavior
- When an algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about
